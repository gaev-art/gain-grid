# Active Context

## Current Status

**Last Task**: WORKOUT-001 - Implement Workout Tracking Data Models
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED & ARCHIVED (Database Schema Phase)
**Date**: 2025-08-16

## Project State

### âœ… Completed Features

1. **DEV-001**: Development environment setup and configuration
2. **AUTH-001**: Complete NextAuth.js authentication system
3. **GOOGLE-OAUTH-001**: Google OAuth integration with redirect fixes
4. **WORKOUT-001 (Database Schema)**: Comprehensive workout tracking data models

### ðŸ”§ Current System Capabilities

- **Authentication**: Email/Password + Google OAuth
- **Database**: Prisma with PostgreSQL, comprehensive workout tracking schema
- **Data Models**: User profiles, training plans, exercises, workout logs, reminders
- **Frontend**: Next.js with shadcn-ui components
- **Backend**: NextAuth.js with proper OAuth handling
- **Development**: Turborepo, TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier

### ðŸ“Š Technical Debt

- API endpoints for new data models still needed
- Service layer for workout tracking functionality not yet implemented
- Production migration strategy needs finalization
- None of these are critical blockers for continued development

## Next Development Opportunities

### ðŸš€ High Priority

1. **API Development**: Implement endpoints for all workout tracking models
2. **Service Layer**: Business logic and validation for workout tracking
3. **User Interface**: Dashboard and workout tracking interface

### ðŸ”„ Medium Priority

1. **Production Migration Strategy**: Finalize approach for database migration
2. **Mobile Integration**: Extend workout tracking to mobile app
3. **Analytics**: Add workout progress visualization

### ðŸ“± Mobile Considerations

- React Native app needs workout tracking features
- Consider shared business logic between web and mobile
- API endpoints should support both platforms

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality

- âœ… TypeScript strict mode
- âœ… ESLint + Prettier configuration
- âœ… Component-based architecture with shadcn-ui
- âœ… Prisma for database operations
- âœ… NextAuth.js for authentication
- âœ… Comprehensive data models with proper relationships

### Testing Strategy

- Validation scripts for database schema (implemented)
- Unit tests for service layer functions (needed)
- API endpoint testing (needed)
- Integration testing for workout tracking flows (needed)

### Deployment Considerations

- Environment variables properly configured
- Google OAuth credentials for production
- Database migrations follow phased approach
- Build optimization with Turborepo
- Production migration needs careful planning

## Team Knowledge

### Recent Learnings

1. **Database Schema Design**: Balancing complexity with flexibility
2. **Migration Strategy**: Phased approach with validation at each step
3. **Data Relationships**: Managing complex relationships between models
4. **Performance Optimization**: Strategic indexing for common queries

### Documentation

- All tasks properly archived with detailed implementation notes
- Comprehensive design documentation from creative phase
- Schema documentation with relationships and indexes
- Migration strategy with phased approach

## Ready for Next Task

The project is in excellent condition for continued development:

- âœ… All core infrastructure in place
- âœ… Authentication system fully functional
- âœ… Comprehensive database schema for workout tracking
- âœ… Clear development path forward
- âœ… Design documentation for next phases

**Recommendation**: Proceed with API development for workout tracking models as the next development phase.
