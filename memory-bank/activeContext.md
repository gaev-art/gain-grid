# Active Context

## Current Status

**Last Task**: GOOGLE-OAUTH-001 - Google OAuth Authentication Integration
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED & ARCHIVED
**Date**: $(date)

## Project State

### âœ… Completed Features

1. **DEV-001**: Development environment setup and configuration
2. **AUTH-001**: Complete NextAuth.js authentication system
3. **GOOGLE-OAUTH-001**: Google OAuth integration with redirect fixes

### ðŸ”§ Current System Capabilities

- **Authentication**: Email/Password + Google OAuth
- **Database**: Prisma with PostgreSQL, updated schema for OAuth users
- **Frontend**: Next.js with shadcn-ui components
- **Backend**: NextAuth.js with proper OAuth handling
- **Development**: Turborepo, TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier

### ðŸ“Š Technical Debt

- None identified
- All critical OAuth issues resolved
- Code quality maintained at production level

## Next Development Opportunities

### ðŸš€ High Priority

1. **Dashboard Features**: Workout tracking, progress monitoring
2. **User Profile Management**: Profile editing, avatar upload
3. **Workout Management**: CRUD operations for workouts

### ðŸ”„ Medium Priority

1. **Progress Analytics**: Charts and progress visualization
2. **Mobile App Integration**: Enhance React Native experience
3. **Social Features**: Friend connections, workout sharing

### ðŸ“± Mobile Considerations

- React Native app exists but needs feature parity
- Consider shared business logic between web and mobile
- API endpoints should support both platforms

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality

- âœ… TypeScript strict mode
- âœ… ESLint + Prettier configuration
- âœ… Component-based architecture with shadcn-ui
- âœ… Prisma for database operations
- âœ… NextAuth.js for authentication

### Testing Strategy

- Component-level testing for UI components
- Integration testing for authentication flows
- End-to-end testing for OAuth processes
- Database migration testing

### Deployment Considerations

- Environment variables properly configured
- Google OAuth credentials for production
- Database migrations ready for production
- Build optimization with Turborepo

## Team Knowledge

### Recent Learnings

1. **OAuth Integration**: Proper redirect handling is critical
2. **Database Design**: Schema must accommodate multiple auth methods
3. **Error Handling**: OAuth flows need comprehensive error management
4. **Testing**: OAuth requires end-to-end validation

### Documentation

- All tasks properly archived with detailed implementation notes
- Setup instructions for Google OAuth included
- Common issues and solutions documented
- Technical decisions and rationale preserved

## Ready for Next Task

The project is in excellent condition for continued development:

- âœ… All core infrastructure in place
- âœ… Authentication system fully functional
- âœ… No technical debt or critical issues
- âœ… Clear development path forward
- âœ… Comprehensive documentation available

**Recommendation**: Proceed with dashboard features or user profile management as next development phase.
